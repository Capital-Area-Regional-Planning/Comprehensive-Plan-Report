<b>Q. How do I change the colors of the graphs or the formats of the tables?</b>

<b>Q. How accurate is this data?</b>
<br>
A. The American Community Survey (ACS) surveys a sample of the U.S. population, so includes a margin of error for each estimate. 
The estimate, margin of error (MOE), coefficient of variation (CV), and interpreted reliability are reported for each variable in the Census Reporting section of the report.
Data from the Decennial Survey is a complete population survey, so does not have a margin of error.
